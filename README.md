# Neural_Networks
---

This repository contains numerous simple Python projects that demonstrate how to build Neural Networks from scratch; from a single neuron, without using any libraries or API's, to building MNIST and Cats and Dogs projects utilizing librariesÂ and machine learning API's.

This repository includes the following:

- #1, #2, and #3 each include .py file including single layer, two layer, and three three layer neurons with sigmoid activation and backpropagation.
- NAND.py implements the NAND gate operation.
The MNIST subdirectory resolves the MNIST dataset in two ways: using the Keras API and manually.
- Cats and Dogs is a binary classification problem addressed using Keras and an optimizer named Adam.
